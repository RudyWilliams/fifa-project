## Clustering Analysis
### K=3 on First Two PCs
![kmeans clustering on pcs](https://github.com/RudyWilliams/fifa-project/blob/master/PCA-Plots/KMclustering_on_PCs.png "Clustered on first two PCs")
  * The *green group* contains teams like Brazil, Portugal, Germany, Argentina, Italy, France, Croatia... good teams. Very good teams. Complete package type of teams. Good offense. Good defense.
  * The *red group* contains teams like Ghana, Sengal, and East African nations (including Egypt)... well respected teams.
  * The *blue group*.  The teams here stay pretty centered in terms of defense with the second principal component scores coming in between -3 and 3. Offense for these teams is average at best. The US/Canada (bc we grouped them together) are very separated offensively (PC1-wise) from the best offensive teams (Portugal, Brazil, Ivory Coast). Being on approximately the same horizontal line, defensive scores are comparable with Portugal and Brazil and better than Ivory Coast. US/Canada is in the range of favorable goalkeeping stats. This may be because of Tim Howard's star power.
